This repository contains my **Competitive Programming (CP)** practice, solutions, and algorithm implementations.  
It is mainly focused on improving **problem-solving skills**, **data structures**, and **algorithms** using **C++**.

## Objectives
- Practice competitive programming regularly.
- Learn and implement core **Data Stucture and Algorithm**
- Strengthen problem-solving ability

## compile and run (bash)
**g++ file_name.cpp -o file_name && ./file_name**
- To put exe or o file in another file <br>
**g++ file_name.cpp -o output/file_name && ./output/file_name**
